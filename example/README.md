# BfsBruteForce Example Code

These examples can be run directly, if you have installed the gem
in your local environment.

    % gem install bfs_brute_force
    % ./two_knights.rb

Or you can run the examples against the latest source in your local
```bfs_brute_force``` git repo, by using the ```run_example.rb```
script, which will use ```bundler``` to load the gem from source.

    % ./run_example.rb two_knights.rb
